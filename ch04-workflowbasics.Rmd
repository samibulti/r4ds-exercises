# 4.4 Practice

1. Why does this code not work?

```{r}
my_variable <- 10
my_varıable
```

**The second line has a character in the variable name different from the first line - `i` vs `ı`

```{r}
my_variable <- 10
my_variable
```

2. Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
ggplot(dota = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

**Fix the typo in `data`**

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

```{r}
fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
```

**Fix the typo in `filter` and add a second equals sign to the condition check**

```{r}
filter(mpg, cyl == 8)
```

```{r}
filter(diamond, carat > 3)
```

**Fix the typo in `diamonds`**

```{r}
filter(diamonds, carat > 3)
```
